GAME FLOW VS GAME STATE

Step 0
Player 1 joins a room, waits for a second player to join. A Game is instantiated.
As the first player, they are assigned the position of small blind.

(server: update player1, initialize game, update room to contain game)

Game state is:

```json
{
  "roomId": 1,
  "stake": 2,
  "seats": 2,
  "game": {
    "gameId": 4,
    "pot": 0,
    "winner": null,
    "board": null,
    "players": [
      {
        "playerId": 3,
        "username": "fred@astair.com",
        "displayName": "Tiny Tim",
        "enabled": true,
        "accountBalance": 25,
        "authorities": ["USER"],
        "holeCards": null,
        "position": "SMALLBLIND",
        "playersAction": false
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Step 1
Player 2 joins room and is assigned the big blind position. Start Game button appears.

(server: update player2, update game to include player2)
(frontend: if players > 1 : show Start Game button)

Game state is:

```json
{
  "roomId": 1,
  "stake": 2,
  "seats": 2,
  "game": {
    "gameId": 4,
    "pot": 0,
    "winner": null,
    "board": null,
    "players": [
      {
        "playerId": 3,
        "username": "fred@astair.com",
        "displayName": "Tiny Tim",
        "enabled": true,
        "accountBalance": 25,
        "authorities": ["USER"],
        "holeCards": null,
        "position": "SMALLBLIND",
        "playersAction": false
      },
      {
        "playerId": 4,
        "username": "billy@bob.com",
        "displayName": null,
        "enabled": true,
        "accountBalance": 80,
        "authorities": ["ADMIN"],
        "holeCards": null,
        "position": "BIGBLIND",
        "playersAction": false
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Step 3
Player 1 clicks Start Game. The following chain of events occur:
- The players are dealt hole cards
- Player1 subtracts the small blind from his balance and adds it to the pot
- Player2 subtracts the big blind from his balance and adds it to the pot
- Player1 is given the option to call, raise, or fold

(server: update player balances, hole cards, and playersAction, update game pot)

The Game state is:
```json
{
  "roomId": 1,
  "stake": 2,
  "seats": 2,
  "game": {
    "gameId": 4,
    "pot": 3,
    "winner": null,
    "board": null,
    "players": [
      {
        "playerId": 3,
        "username": "fred@astair.com",
        "displayName": "Tiny Tim",
        "enabled": true,
        "accountBalance": 24,
        "authorities": ["USER"],
        "holeCards": ["EIGHT_OF_SPADES", "SIX_OF_SPADES"],
        "position": "SMALLBLIND",
        "playersAction": true
      },
      {
        "playerId": 4,
        "username": "billy@bob.com",
        "displayName": null,
        "enabled": true,
        "accountBalance": 78,
        "authorities": ["ADMIN"],
        "holeCards": ["SEVEN_OF_HEARTS", "TWO_OF_DIAMONDS"],
        "position": "BIGBLIND",
        "playersAction": false
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Step 4
Player1 chooses an action. In this case, to raise the minimum bet ($2).
- Player1 subtracts from his balance and adds to pot

(server: update player1 balance, switch playersAction for both players, update game pot)

Step 5
Player2 chooses an action. In this case, to call
